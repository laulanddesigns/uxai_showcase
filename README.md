# UX/UI & AI Automation Portfolio

This is a simple, static portfolio site for showcasing professional UX/UI design and AI automation services. It follows a clean, product‑oriented style with a single accent color, clear typography, and a well‑structured layout.  
The site is built with plain HTML and CSS so it’s easy to host on Netlify or any other static site provider.  

## Pages

* **Home (`index.html`)** – Introduces who you are and what you offer. Includes a hero section, service overview, industries served, featured case study placeholders, process summary and footer.
* **Services (`services.html`)** – Describes your UX/UI design and AI automation services in more detail.
* **Case Studies (`case-studies.html`)** – Lists up to ten project cards with industry, problem statement and status to show your roadmap.
* **Process (`process.html`)** – Outlines the steps you follow on every engagement: discover, design, build, automate and optimize.
* **About (`about.html`)** – Provides a brief professional bio that emphasises systems thinking and cross‑disciplinary expertise.
* **Contact (`contact.html`)** – Contains a simple contact form and your email address so people can reach out.

All pages share a consistent navigation bar and footer. You can extend or change the content of any page to reflect your work.

## Deploying on Netlify

1. Create a new site from your Netlify dashboard.
2. Link the `portfolio-site` directory (or push it to a repository and connect that repository) when prompted.
3. Netlify will automatically detect that this is a static site and deploy it without requiring any build settings.

Alternatively you can compress the folder and upload it using Netlify’s drag‑and‑drop deploy.
